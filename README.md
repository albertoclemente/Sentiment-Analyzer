# Sentiment Analysis Implementation Review

This code implements a rule-based sentiment analysis tool using predefined lexicons. 

## Key Observations:

1. The algorithm uses a bag-of-words approach that ignores word order and context
2. The normalization formula accounts for all tokens (including neutral ones), which reduces the impact of sentiment words in longer texts
3. The implementation lacks handling for negations (e.g., "not happy")
4. The sentiment threshold of Â±0.2 provides a buffer for classifying neutral text
5. The confidence check requires at least 2 sentiment-bearing words to make a determination
6. The simple tokenization may create issues with compound words and stemming variations

This rule-based method provides interpretable results but will be less accurate than modern machine learning approaches for complex sentiment analysis tasks.
